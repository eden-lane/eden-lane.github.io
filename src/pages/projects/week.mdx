The project I've been working on since the end of 2020 is a 
task management tool that helps you plan your tasks using a 
built-in calendar. I really love to-do lists and haven't found 
an app that fully meets my needs, so I decided to create my own. 
I also enjoy designing, coding, and learning new things, which 
are all important skills when building something like Week.
<br />
I have many ideas for the future of the application, but I 
also don't forget to polish existing features and fix bugs. 
I would love to hear your feedback and ideas. If you have something 
to share, don't hesitate to write to me at
