The project I'm working on since the end of 2020. 
It's a task management tool where you need to plan your tasks 
with a help of built in calendar. I like todo lists like no one 
else does and I haven't found the app that satisfies me on 100%, 
so I decided to create my own. I also like to design, to code 
and to learn new things which are important skills when you're 
going to spend a few years on building something like Week.
<br />
I have a lot of ideas in my mind about the future of the application, 
but I also don't forget about polishing existing features and fixing bugs. 
It would be wonderful to hear your feedback and ideas. Don't hesitate 
to write to me if you have something to share -
